///     <para>
///         The value is named by an ordered chain of ordinary diagnostic paths, not by an object
///         reference or an opaque handle the agent would have to keep alive between calls. Each
///         entry resolves against the diagnostics produced by the previous one, so a chain of two
///         means "render the process, take this property's value, render THAT, take this property".
///         Nothing is retained on the agent between requests, and a path that no longer resolves —
///         the object was replaced, the collection shrank — fails as a lookup rather than handing
///         back a stale object that is still rooted only because a drilldown was once opened on it.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The same chain travels with a nested property edit or operation, which is what makes an
///         action inside a drilldown run against the object the operator is looking at.
