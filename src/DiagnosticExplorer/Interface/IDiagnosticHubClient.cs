///     Calls the service makes INTO an agent. The request/response members return a value, which

///     AsyncResultBucket.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     SignalR does NOT own the timeout, which the AsyncResultBucket did (a 10 second ceiling).
///     A client result invoked without a token waits forever: SignalR's TypedClientBuilder passes
///     CancellationToken.None when the interface method declares no trailing CancellationToken
///     (TypedClientBuilder.cs, release/8.0, lines 148-152 and 214-222), and an agent that never
///     sends a completion — because its response failed to serialise, say — then parks the caller
///     indefinitely on a connection that is otherwise healthy. Hence the trailing token on every
///     member that waits for a value; TypedClientBuilder strips it from the wire arguments and
///     hands it to InvokeCoreAsync.
