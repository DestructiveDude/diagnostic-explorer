/// <summary>
///     The former name of <see cref="DiagnosticPropertyAttribute" />, kept so existing call sites
///     keep compiling. Prefer <see cref="DiagnosticPropertyAttribute" /> in new code.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     This is a subclass rather than a type alias because attribute discovery runs through
///     <c>GetCustomAttributes(typeof(DiagnosticPropertyAttribute), false)</c>, which matches any
///     assignable attribute type. A property marked <c>[Property]</c> is therefore found by the same
///     query as one marked <c>[DiagnosticProperty]</c>, with no branch anywhere in the pipeline. The
///     consuming estate has upwards of 300 such call sites; the alternative was a mechanical rename
///     across all of them for no behavioural gain.
